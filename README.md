### Overview
This is a simple Python script that calculates your age based on the year you were born. It prompts the user to input their birth year, calculates their age, and then asks if the user wants to use the age calculator again.

### Instructions
1. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script named `age_calculator.py`.

2. **Input Birth Year**: When prompted, enter the year you were born.

3. **View Result**: The script will calculate your age based on the current year and display it.

4. **Repeat or Exit**: After displaying the age, the script will ask if you want to use the age calculator again. Enter "yes" to calculate another age or "no" to exit the program.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x

### Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `age_calculator.py` file.
3. Run the script by entering `python age_calculator.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your birth year and see the result.

### Example
```
$ python age_calculator.py
This is a simple age calculator
What year were you born? 1990
Your age is 34
Do you want to use the age finder again? yes
What year were you born? 1985
Your age is 39
Do you want to use the age finder again? no
Program ended successfully
```

### Notes
- The script uses the `date` module from Python's `datetime` library to get the current year.
- Ensure to input the birth year as a four-digit integer (e.g., 1990, not '90').
